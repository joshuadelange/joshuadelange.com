	<h1>I am a digital creative passionate about innovating in missions</h1>

<div class="narrow">
	
	<p>I work with the international missions movement <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ywam.org/about-us/">Youth With A Mission</a> (YWAM) in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ywamamsterdam.org">Amsterdam</a>.</p>

	<p>YWAM currently has over 1000 operating locations and has send out over 5 million missionaries into all countries over the world since its beginning in 1960.</p>

	<p>I don’t know how to put this, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8OxKx6zKkQ">but we’re kind of a big deal</a>.</p>

	<h2>Together with some other passionate people located all over the world I work on some pretty cool stuff;</h2>

		<h3>Getting missionaries out there</h3>
		<p>In order to get more missionaries out there changing the world for Jesus, I’ve been involved with creating websites for YWAM worldwide and YWAM locations in Kona and Amsterdam.</p>

		<p>The first step of supporting missionaries in their work is to guide them to the place where they fit best.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="column-4">
		<h3>Sharing our amazing stories</h3>
		<p>Things that happen on the mission field are amazing and are always very inspirational for myself personally to hear.</p>

		<p>Together with the communications team in Amsterdam, we’re working on a platform where these stories can be told in a beautifully designed multimedia experience.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="column-4">
		<h3>Analyzing our efforts</h3>
		<p>In order to be more strategic with our efforts, I’m also involved in creating different tools to track and visualize where we go and what exactly we do.</p>

		<p>This idea resulted in the development of mobile and web applications that will not only be used by YWAM, but by other missions organizations as well.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="column-4">
		<h3>Changing the way we read the bible</h3>
		<p>One of the biggest reasons the reformation stuck around like it did was not only the fact that more people had the bible in their own language, but also new innovations on the printing press that made the distribution possible.</p>

		<p>With our world changing so fast by the digital innovation, I’ve been working with a group of people that are planning on creating a new digital format to read the bible in.</p>

	<p>I think that summarizes it quite well for now! If you feel like you’d get involved with any of this or you’d just like to say hi, you can follow me on twitter, subscribe to my newsletter, or send me an old fashioned email message.</p>
