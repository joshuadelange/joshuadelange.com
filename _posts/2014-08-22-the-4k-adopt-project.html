		<p>Since 1960 YWAM has been sending missionary teams to places all over the world to tell everyone about Jesus, make people’s lives better and train them to be more awesome at society.</p>

		<p>‘Going to the ends of the earth’ is kind of a big thing to do, and to make sure YWAM went everywhere, they recorded what countries they went to.</p>

		<p>This went all great and amazing, but when somewhere in the 90’s YWAM went to the last country on earth, I like to imagine they had a little ‘um, …now what?’ moment.</p>

		<p>Then one day, the brilliant concept of ‘Omega Zones’ was created. Instead of of just checking off countries, the world would be split up based off population instead of only existing geopolitical boundaries.</p>

		<p class="quote">“These boundaries aren’t good enough for us; lets make our own!”</p>
		<p class="quote-author">Such a ywam-y thing to say.</p>


		<p>A magical formula was released upon the world and we ended up with four thousand of these Omega Zones; therefore, the framework would be called 4k.</p>

		<p>Good stuff. The 4k framework has been around for a while and have been used as a common language between major missions organizations. But now, it’s all about to get Omega Zone crazy over here.</p>

		<h2>4k adopt</h2>

	<div class="narrow">


		<p>In a few weeks, hundreds of YWAM leaders from around the world will come together to strategize, collaborate and dream together on how to be even better at what we do.</p>

		<p>One of the things that will be implemented will be a project we’re calling ‘4k Adopt’. The idea is that all these YWAM leaders will ‘adopt’ Omega Zones. With this adoption, they’re saying they'll send teams there, start activities there or in any way engage that region with the work they’re doing.</p>

		<p>The cool thing is that they’re shooting for adopting all 4000+ Omega Zones by the year 2020.(Having a vision for 2020 has lately been the thing to do in the changing the world business)</p>

		<p>Having hundreds of missionary leaders strategize and collaborate on how to impact every single region of the world by the year 2020 is pretty significant. But, you may wonder, how does that all work out logistically?</p>

		<p>Our mission, if we would choose to accepted it (and we totally did);</p>

		<p class="quote">Enable hundreds of leaders within a limited time together commit to 4000+ regions of the world and give them the ability to see each others activity as they go.</p>

		<p>So here’s the recipe for awesomeness we came up with;</p>

		<p>1x huge floor map for people to walk over with, get a good overview of the situation.</p>
		<em>Created by the one and only map queen of missions; Jill Thornton (she’s kinda good at these floor maps)</em>

		<p>1x app, for Android and iOS for people to indicate they’re adopting the Omega Zone they’re walking on and by what year they expect to be there.</p>
		<em>Built out by the fearless Min Seong Kang and his intimidating army of Korean coders.</em>

		<p>1x realtime updating map with a sweet looking countdown and live stream of activity.</p>
		<em>Together with the above mentioned fearless Min Seong Kang, I had the create pleasure of building out something pretty.</em>

		<p>People will walk over the map, adopt the Omega Zone on their phone and see their Omega Zone turn red on the big screen. I think geographic data visualizations aren’t just a ‘nice thing to have’. I believe they’re crucial for people to understand what is happening and get them thinking on how to get involved.</p>

		<p>With all of this hard work, we’ve hoped to created tools for missions leaders worldwide to strategize together on how to reach that last people group with Jesus’ love, care for those who live in the margins of societies anywhere in the world and teach those societies on how to structure themselves Gods way.</p>

		<p>The meeting is in a few weeks. I’ll let you know how it went!</p>

		<h2>Nerd alert; technical details!</h2>

	</div>

	<div class="narrow">

		<p>Technically, this project was super interesting! Throwing 4000+ polygons in a web browser is always asking for performance challenges, but we’ve been working hard to minimize those and I feel good at the place we’ve been able to take it.</p>

		<p>Optimizing tiled polygons, vector rendering and more of that good stuff was awesome to work on. It also was the first time for me working with web sockets to make sure the map would realtime update with the least performance overhead as possible.</p>

		<p>Technology used;</p>
		<ul>
		<li>HTML, CSS, Javascript (Obviously)</li>
		<li>Mapping libraries; leaflet.js + esri-leaflet.js</li
		<li>Omega Zone polygon data API; ArcGIS Online</li>
		<li>Adoption data API; Django + Django REST framework (mostly done by Min)</li>
		<li>Websockets magic; Custom built NodeJS server</li>

		<p class="quote">Being nerdy and changing the world. A pretty sweet combination!</p>
