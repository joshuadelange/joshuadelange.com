		<p>I love projects where my passion for both technology and missions collide in a big way. The UofN ERP project I’ve been involved with the past 6 months is a good example of such a project.</p>

		<h3>Training missionaries</h3>

		<p>The University of the Nations, or the UofN for short, represents the training side of YWAM and aims to train missionaries to be more awesome at being a missionary.</p>

		<p>The UofN currently has 580 locations in over 160 countries and has courses in more than 90 languages. They have about 16.000 students every year. At any given time, there are about 2.000 outreach teams anywhere in the world, making the UofN the engine behind one of the biggest evangelistic movements in history. I think thats pretty cool!</p>

		<h3>But... paperwork...</h3>
		<p>I get really excited thinking about all the beautiful things that God is doing through all of these people, but I get slightly overwhelmed when I realise the massive amount of administration work that must be behind all of this. There is quite a bit of paperwork needed to make sure this party keeps on going in the right direction.</p>

		<p>And this is where technology can play a really cool role. Whenever the paperwork is limiting missionaries to do what they do best, we can use technology to make the administrative work more efficient and easier to do.</p>

		<h3>One system to help them all</h3>
		<p>This is what the UofN ERP project is doing. It’s a massive system to automate and make it easer to do a ton of stuff that needs to be done to make sure the students get properly trained and sent out.</p>

		<p>This is not an easy project and quite the ambitious undertaking. Initially I was quite overwhelmed and was wondering how in the world we would be able to pull this off. YWAM is a non-profit organisation and doesn’t have a ton of money to throw at a system like this. It takes a rare combination of very specific skillets to not just get the system out of the door, but also make sure it really blesses the organisation as much as we’re wanting it to do.</p>

		<p>But I guess I didn’t calculate in the God variable. God has brought together an amazing team full of diverse expertise and experience, we’re able to really forward move as one quickly and have been building so many critical building blocks of the system already. I am really excited to see this go forward even more within the next few months.</p>

		<p>Personally I’ve been mainly involved with the user experience design of the system. It has been so fun taking complex aspects of the system and try to come up with an elegant and beautiful solution. I believe these things are so important to make it as easy as possible for people to use the system.</p>

		<p>Thinking about this project makes me so excited. I get to learn so many things from truly experienced professionals and get to contribute to building out technology that will put some serious rocket boosters under a movement that is already doing so much beautiful work with God.</p>
